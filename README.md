# My match 3 game

My small and simple little match-3 game that I've made with Phaser 3 and SolidJs

## TODO

-   [ ] Make better import for all css, like import all css in one global css file
-   [X] Structure ui folder better
-   [ ] Make useful css variables and best practices, look at Kevin Powell videos
-   [ ] When game is done, restructure, clean up and make into a template
    -   [ ] Document this template as well, the css classes, util functions, the event system and so forth
-   [ ] Make the background of the popup clickable to be able to close it that way as well
    -   [ ] Add a settings button to the popup as well
-   [ ] Create nice bokeh effect
-   [ ] Fix layouting in mobile layouts and sizing
